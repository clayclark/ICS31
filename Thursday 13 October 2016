## Developing the Restaurants program (11:00 version)

"""
One way to partition/organize the project:
    Model:  How the program "thinks" about things internally.
        Here, a Restaurant namedtuple and a list of Restaurants.
        Usually stays same, no matter platform (phone, tablet, ...)
    View:  How the program appears to the user.  (User Interface)
        Text-oriented, conversational, menu-driven.

We'll start with the view; it's quicker gratification.

The code above works.  But it's kind of clunky, with all its ifs
and elses, and the questions straggle diagonally down the page.
There's a cleaner syntax for this kind of question, no-well-is-it-THIS,
no-well-is-it-THAT, no-well-is-it-the-other pattern.
As soon as you get an answer, you're done.
Often in classifying kinds of situations.

# and what the function does.  That limits what the caller of these
# functions needs to know. ("Information Hiding")

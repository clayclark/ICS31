# Sorting the collection
#######################################

#   comparisons in the sort.
# So first we define that function

# Song-displays
###################################
# But these songs don't have their album information!  We removed it when we created
# the list of all songs.  If we want to display selected songs on our iPod screen,
# we'd want to have the album information along with the song information.

# We could flatten out our data structure, storing a copy of the album
# information with each song:
#       1   Up  Peter Gabriel  2002  1  Darkness   411   5
#       1   Up  Peter Gabriel  2002  2  Growing Up   453  8
#       1   Up  Peter Gabriel  2002  3  Sky Blue    397  2
#            ...
# This would work, but there's a lot of duplicate data---it would be wasteful of storage
# and error-prone to store our music data this way permanently.

# Instead, let's just get the album info that goes with a song WHEN WE NEED IT,
# during the computation.  To do this, we define a structure that contains the
# info we need to display a song (on our iPod screen, e.g.)---song details plus
# the info we need from that song's album:

Songdisplay = namedtuple('Songdisplay', 'artist a_title year track s_title length play_count')

# discarding them as we're done; this doesn't affect the main, permanent
# list of albums (like the one we defined as MUSIC above).

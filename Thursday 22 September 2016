A typical computer system [slightly enhanced from class]:
    HARDWARE:  Equipment
      Internal:  Processor (CPU), Storage (memory, RAM, disks)
      External, peripherals:  keyboard, mouse, screen, speaker, printer, ...
    SOFTWARE:  Steps the computer follows.
    DATA (Ingredients).

    Our focus is mostly on the software (and a little on the data)
    Software: Instructions
      Cook's recipes are software, written in terms a cook understands.
      Algorithm:  Step-by-step process leading to solution of a problem.
      A recipe is an algorithm, written in language a cook understands.
      An algorithm written in a form a computer can follow is a
        COMPUTER PROGRAM.
      CODE:  The text of a computer program.
